The Boardman-Vogt tensor product of operads encodes the notion of interchanging algebraic structures. A classic result of Dunn tells us that the tensor product of two little cube operads is equivalent to a little cube operad with the dimensions added together. As models for $$\mathbb{E}_k$$-operads, this reflects a defining property of these operads. In this talk, we will explore some equivariant generalizations to Dunn’s additivity. Along the way, we will play with little star-shaped operads, question if we really need group representations for equivariant operads, and learn to love (and hate) the tensor product.

Topological field theories live in the intersection of algebraic topology and mathematical physics. They initially served as a rigorous foundation for some aspects of the path integrals appearing in physics, especially quantum field theory (hence the name), and then were extensively studied in conjunction with mirror symmetry and gauge theories. They’re defined formally as monoidal functors from a higher category of bordisms and they are a source of examples for invariants of manifolds (topological or with geometric structures), are connected to representation theory via tensor categories, and serve as a sort of “testing ground” for our understanding of higher categories. <br><br>

In this talk I will forgo the physics aspect completely and instead focus on the general theory, along with an introduction to the higher categorical framework that allows us to define these objects. We will then see an example of a 3-dimensional TFT which is supposed to compute some so-called Rozansky-Witten invariants of 3-manifolds.
