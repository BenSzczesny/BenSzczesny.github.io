**The homotopy theory of ideals structured by operads**<br> David White </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td markdown="span">
In 2006, Jeff Smith gave a talk explaining how to define ideals in the context of ring spectra, and laying out applications to algebraic K-theory computations. In 2014, Mark Hovey posted a preprint working out the homotopy theory of such ideals. Since every map is homotopic to an inclusion, ideals must be defined diagrammatically rather than as subobjects. In this talk, I will explain the definition, and then discuss joint work with Donald Yau that extends Hovey’s work to develop a homotopy theory of ideals with additional structure encoded by an operad. If there’s time, I’ll discuss ongoing work in progress to carry out Smith’s plan regarding algebraic K-theory.

**Equivariant Dunn Additivity**<br> Ben Szczesny </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td markdown="span">
The Boardman-Vogt tensor product of operads encodes the notion of interchanging algebraic structures. A classic result of Dunn tells us that the tensor product of two little cube operads is equivalent to a little cube operad with the dimensions added together. As models for $$\mathbb{E}_k$$-operads, this reflects a defining property of these operads. In this talk, we will explore some equivariant generalizations to Dunn’s additivity. Along the way, we will play with little star-shaped operads, question if we really need group representations for equivariant operads, and learn to love (and hate) the tensor product.

**A 3-dimensional TFT with many applications** <br> [Lorenzo Riva (University of Notre Dame)](https://sites.google.com/nd.edu/lorenzo-riva/home) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td markdown="span">
Topological field theories live in the intersection of algebraic topology and mathematical physics. They initially served as a rigorous foundation for some aspects of the path integrals appearing in physics, especially quantum field theory (hence the name), and then were extensively studied in conjunction with mirror symmetry and gauge theories. They’re defined formally as monoidal functors from a higher category of bordisms and they are a source of examples for invariants of manifolds (topological or with geometric structures), are connected to representation theory via tensor categories, and serve as a sort of “testing ground” for our understanding of higher categories. <br><br>

In this talk I will forgo the physics aspect completely and instead focus on the general theory, along with an introduction to the higher categorical framework that allows us to define these objects. We will then see an example of a 3-dimensional TFT which is supposed to compute some so-called Rozansky-Witten invariants of 3-manifolds.

**Mackey and Tambara Functors Beyond Equivariant Homotopy** <br> [Ben Spitz (University of California, Los Angeles)](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~benspitz/) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td markdown="span">
"Classically", Mackey and Tambara functors are equivariant generalizations of abelian groups and commutative rings, respectively. What this means is that, in equivariant homotopy theory, Mackey functors appear wherever one would expect to find abelian groups, and Tambara functors appear wherever one would expect to find commutative rings. More recently, work by Bachmann has garnered interest in related structures which appear in motivic homotopy theory -- these Motivic Mackey Functors and Motivic Tambara Functors do not have anything to do with group-equivariance, but have the same axiomatics. In this talk, I'll introduce a general context for interpreting the notions of Mackey and Tambara Functors, which subsumes both the equivariant and motivic notions. The aim of this approach is to translate theorems between contexts, enriching the theory and providing cleaner proofs of essential facts. To this end, I'll discuss recent progress in boosting a foundational result about norms from equivariant algebra to this more general context.

**A scanning construction of the self duality of the little disks operad** <br> [Connor Malin (University of Notre Dame)](https://cwmalin214.github.io/) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td markdown="span">
Since the introduction of Koszul duality for operads, algebraists and homotopy theorists alike have wanted to understand its effect on the little disks operad En. Over the course of the last 30 years, our knowledge has steadily advanced. People showed (roughly chronologically) that H_*(En),C_*(En;Q),C_*(En;Z), and the categories of En algebras themselves were all self dual, finally culminating in the fact that the En operad in spectra is self dual. In this talk, we give a new, particularly tractable construction of the self duality of the spectral En operad and describe how it interacts with factorization homology.

**Telescopic stable homotopy theory** <br> [Ishan Levy (MIT)](https://ishanina.github.io/) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td markdown="span">
Chromatic homotopy theory attempts to study the stable homotopy category by breaking it into v_n-periodic layers corresponding to height n formal groups. There are two natural ways to do this, via either the K(n)-localizations which are computationally accessible, or via the T(n)-localizations, which detect the v_n-periodic parts of the stable homotopy groups of spheres. Ravenel's telescope conjecture asks that these two localizations agree. For n at least 2 and all primes, I will discuss counterexamples to Ravenel’s telescope conjecture. Our counterexamples come from using trace methods to compute the T(n) and K(n)-localizations of the algebraic K-theory of a family of ring spectra, which in the case n=2 are certain finite Galois extensions of the K(1)-local sphere. I will then explain that this can be used to obtain an infinite family of elements in the v_n-periodic stable homotopy groups of spheres, giving the best known lower bound on the asymptotic average ranks of the stable stems. Finally, I will explain that the Galois group of the T(n)-local category agrees with that of the K(n)-local category, and how the failure of the telescope conjecture comes entirely from the failure of Galois hyperdescent. This talk comes from projects that are joint with Burklund, Carmeli, Clausen, Hahn, Schlank, and Yanovski.
