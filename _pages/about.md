I am a Ross Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.osu.edu/) at [Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/). 

My research interests lie in equivariant homotopy theory. You can see the research tab for more information on this.

I finished my PhD in 2023 from [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/) where I worked on equivariant operad theory under the guidance of [Mike Hill](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~mikehill/).
